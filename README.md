1. Download the [Splitview plugin](https://github.com/jenstornell/splitview/archive/master.zip)
1. Put the `splitview` folder in /plugins/. If folder is another name like `splitview-master`, rename it to `splitview`.
2. Add `<?php echo splitview(); ?>` right before `</body>` in your footer of all your pages.
3. Login to the panel. When logged in, go to the frontend of your site.
4. Press `alt + s` to activate the Splitview.

## Views

There are two columns, panel and site. Panel is the Kirby panel and site is your frontend. You can make each column expand to full width.

## Troubleshooting

### Mobile device

Splitview does not work well on mobile devices because the screen is too narrow. Don't even try it.

### Desktop

- Make sure you followed all steps correctly in Setup.
- If you have added splitview options, try to remove them and see if that works.
- Check for javascript errors. If other scripts don't work, Splitview javascript can be prevented from runnig.
- Look for `<!-- Splitview # Start -->` in your source. If it's not there, the plugin does not run.

If problem remains, add an issue and describe as good as you can what does not work.
